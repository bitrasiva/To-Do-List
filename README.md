This HTML document represents the structure of a simple To-Do List application. Let's break down its components:

1. **Title**:
   - The title of the application is "To-Do List".

2. **Header**:
   - The `<h1>` heading displays the title of the application: "To-Do List".

3. **Input Container**:
   - This `<div>` element with the class "input-container" contains the input field and the button for adding tasks.
   
4. **Task Input Field**:
   - Inside the input container, there is an `<input>` element with the id "task-input" where users can enter their tasks.
   
5. **Add Task Button**:
   - Next to the task input field, there is a `<button>` element with the id "add-task-btn" that users can click to add the task they entered.

6. **Task List Container**:
   - Below the input container, there is a `<div>` element with the id "task-list". This is where the list of tasks will be displayed.
   
7. **JavaScript**:
   - At the end of the body, there is a `<script>` tag that links to an external JavaScript file "script.js". This file contains the functionality for adding tasks, displaying them on the list, and handling user interactions.

Overall, this HTML structure provides a basic framework for a To-Do List application, allowing users to input tasks and view them in a list format. The CSS styles referenced in the "styles.css" file would be responsible for the visual appearance of the application.
